# libEnsemble Community Examples
A selection of libEnsemble functions and complete workflows from the community.
Many previously built-in libEnsemble examples have been moved here
for easier discoverability. See the various READMEs for more information.

1. #### VTMOP
    *Optimization Generator Function*

    VTMOP is a Fortran 2008 package containing a robust, portable solver and
    a flexible framework for solving MOPs. Designed for efficiency and
    scalability to an arbitrary number of objectives, VTMOP attempts to generate
    uniformly spaced points on a (possibly nonconvex) Pareto front with minimal
    cost function evaluations.

2. #### LibE-DDMD
    *Complete Workflow*

    A complete Molecular-Dynamics / Machine-Learning adaptive
    simulation loop based on [DeepDriveMD](https://deepdrivemd.github.io/).
    The simulation function parameterizes and executes molecular-dynamics evaluations
    from DeepDriveMD, while the persistent generator function runs each of DeepDriveMD's
    machine-learning training and model selection instances on the output.
    The generator then selects the most promising output for subsequent MD tasks.
    See ``ddmd/readme.md`` for more information. Constructed by the libEnsemble team
    with help from [the DeepDriveMD team](https://deepdrivemd.github.io/team.html).
