# libEnsemble Community Examples
A selection of libEnsemble functions and complete workflows from the community.
Many previously built-in libEnsemble examples have been moved here
for easier discoverability. See the various READMEs and ``test_*.py`` scripts for more information.

1. #### VTMOP
    *Optimization Generator Function*

    VTMOP is a Fortran 2008 package containing a robust, portable solver and
    a flexible framework for solving MOPs. Designed for efficiency and
    scalability to an arbitrary number of objectives, VTMOP attempts to generate
    uniformly spaced points on a (possibly nonconvex) Pareto front with minimal
    cost function evaluations.

    Article No. 31, pp. 1â€“12. DOI: 10.22360/springsim.2020.hpc.001
    ```

    Originally included in libEnsemble v0.8.0. See [here](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble/tree/v0.8.0/libensemble/gen_funcs/vtmop_libe).

2. #### LibE-DDMD
    *Complete Workflow*

    A complete Molecular-Dynamics / Machine-Learning adaptive
    simulation loop based on [DeepDriveMD](https://deepdrivemd.github.io/).
    The simulation function runs molecular-dynamics evaluations using DeepDriveMD's
    ``run_openmm.py``, while the persistent generator function runs the remaining
    machine-learning training and model selection operations on the output.
    The generator parameterizes subsequent MD runs by selecting outlier points.
    See ``ddmd/readme.md`` for more information. Constructed by the libEnsemble team
    as a proof-of-concept with help from [the DeepDriveMD team](https://deepdrivemd.github.io/team.html).

    Originally included in libEnsemble v0.8.0. See [here](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble/tree/v0.8.0/libensemble/tests/scaling_tests/ddmd).

3. #### DEAP-NSGA-II
   *Optimization Generator Function*

   A persistent generator function that interfaces with the [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap),
   evolutionary algorithms as generator functions. This example demonstrates the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization
   strategy. The generator evaluates the "fitness" of current population members
   and requests their evaluation from the libEnsemble's manager. The manager
   returns corresponding "fitness values" for each objective.

   Originally included in libEnsemble v0.7.0. The most recent version was distributed
   with libEnsemble v0.8.0. See [here](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble/blob/v0.8.0/libensemble/tests/regression_tests/test_deap_nsga2.py).
